### Fix Log

<!-- Add new fixes at the top of this list -->
<!-- Format: - **[Date] Issue**: Brief description of fix -->

- **[2025-01] Block manager unavailable in certain methods**: `dexHelper.blockManager` is not available in `getTopPoolsForToken()` and `updatePoolState()` methods since these are called on a service that does not have it implemented. Use direct RPC calls (e.g., `dexHelper.provider.getBlock('latest')`) instead when block data is needed in these methods.

- **[2025-01] Remove unused ABIs when removing DEXes**: When removing DEX integrations, also remove their associated ABI files from `src/abi/` if no longer referenced. Use `grep` to verify ABIs are not imported elsewhere before deletion.

- **[2025-01] Reuse Interface instances**: Move `factoryIface = new Interface(...)` to class property instead of creating in method. Avoids repeated instantiation on each call.

- **[2025-01] PharaohV3 fee updates fix**: Extracted `buildFeeCallData()` method from `updateAllPoolFees()` so PharaohV3 can override it. PharaohV3 uses `pool.fee()` on pool contract, not `factory.getSwapFee()`.

- **[2025-01] VelodromeSlipstream RPC optimization**: Centralized per-pool `factory.getSwapFee()` calls into a single batched interval at DEX level. Used `multiWrapper.tryAggregate()` to batch calls, `setState()` for immutable state updates, master/slave check to prevent duplicate RPC calls, and proper interval cleanup in `releaseResources()`.

- **[2025-01] Avoid analytics logging**: Don't add success/failure count logs (e.g., `Updated ${successCount}/${totalCount} pools`). Log only important operations, warnings for failures, and errors with context. Analytics-style logs create unnecessary noise.

## Repository Overview

**ParaSwap DexLib** is a library used by ParaSwap backend to integrate with 90+ decentralized exchanges. It enables DEX developers to integrate their protocols by creating pull requests to this repository.

## Common Commands

Package manager: **pnpm** (pinned via `packageManager` in `package.json`, activated by corepack which ships with Node 22). Run `corepack enable` once locally if `pnpm` isn't yet on your PATH.

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Building

```bash
pnpm build              # Run prettier, eslint, and compile TypeScript
pnpm watch              # Watch mode for development
pnpm check:tsc          # TypeScript compilation check only
pnpm check:es           # ESLint check only
pnpm check:pq           # Prettier check only
pnpm checks             # Run all checks (prettier, tsc, eslint)
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run integration-specific tests (includes integration, events, and e2e tests)
pnpm test-integration <dex-name>

# Run a single test file
pnpm test <path-to-test-file>

# Examples:
pnpm test src/dex/uniswap-v3/uniswap-v3-integration.test.ts
pnpm test src/dex/curve-v1/curve-v1-events.test.ts
```

### DEX Integration

```bash
# Initialize a new DEX integration (creates template code)
pnpm init-integration <your-dex-name>
```

DEX names must be in `param-case` format. After initialization, add the DEX to the `Dexes` array in `src/dex/index.ts`.

## Architecture Overview

### Event-Based Pricing System

ParaSwap uses an **event-based architecture** that eliminates expensive fullnode RPC calls during pricing:

1. **Initial State**: DEX pool state is fetched once via Multicall on initialization
2. **Event Subscription**: Pools subscribe to relevant contract events (e.g., Uniswap `Sync`, Curve `TokenExchange`)
3. **State Updates**: Event subscriber processes logs and updates in-memory state cache
4. **Pricing**: Price calculations use cached state without RPC calls

**Key Classes**:

- `StatefulEventSubscriber`: Base class for event-driven state management
  - Implements `processLog()` to update state from events
  - Implements `generateState()` to reconstruct state from on-chain calls
- `StatefulRpcPoller`: Alternative for DEXes without good event support (polls contract state periodically)
- `ComposedEventSubscriber`: For DEXes with multiple event sources

### Core Abstractions

#### IDex Interface

Each DEX implements the `IDex` interface with three main responsibilities:

**Pricing (`IDexPricing<ExchangeData>`)**:

- `getPoolIdentifiers(srcToken, destToken)`: Returns identifiers for pools that can swap between tokens
- `getPricesVolume(srcToken, destToken, amounts, side)`: Calculates swap prices for given amounts
- `getTopPoolsForToken(token, limit)`: Returns most liquid pools for routing optimization

**Transaction Building (`IDexTxBuilder<ExchangeData>`)**:

_V6 Methods (Augustus V6)_:

- `getDexParam()`: Generic parameter encoding with context awareness
- `getDirectParamV6()`: Direct execution parameters

**ExchangeData Type**: Each DEX defines its own `ExchangeData` type containing pool-specific parameters (e.g., Uniswap V3's `path` and `deadline`, Curve's `poolAddress` and `underlyingSwap`).

#### DexHelper - Central Utility Provider

`IDexHelper` is injected into every DEX and provides:

- **RPC Access**: `provider` (ethers), `web3Provider` (web3)
- **Multicall**: `multiContract`, `multiWrapper` - batch on-chain calls efficiently
- **Caching**: `cache` - in-memory cache with TTL
- **HTTP**: `httpRequest` - rate-limited HTTP client
- **Block Management**: `blockManager` - event log subscription
- **Utilities**: `augustusApprovals`, `promiseScheduler`, token price helpers

**Always use Multicall** via `dexHelper.multiWrapper.aggregate()` to batch RPC calls and minimize costs.

### DEX Integration Structure

Each DEX follows this standardized layout:

```
src/dex/<dex-name>/
├── <dex-name>.ts              # Main DEX class implementing IDex
├── <dex-name>-pool.ts         # Event subscriber for pool state (if event-based)
├── <dex-name>-factory.ts      # Pool discovery/management (if applicable)
├── types.ts                   # ExchangeData and config types
├── config.ts                  # Network-specific configuration
├── contract-math/             # Replication of on-chain math
├── forks/                     # Protocol forks (if applicable)
└── *.test.ts                  # Integration, events, and e2e tests
```

### Testing Strategy

Each DEX requires three types of tests:

1. **Integration Tests** (`*-integration.test.ts`): Validates `getPoolIdentifiers()`, `getPricesVolume()`, gas estimates
2. **Events Unit Tests** (`*-events.test.ts`): Tests event processing and state management
3. **E2E Tests** (`*-e2e.test.ts`): Full swap simulation with Tenderly fork, tests transaction building and execution
   **Executors** are smart contracts that atomically:

4. Receive tokens from user
5. Execute DEX swaps
6. Return output tokens
7. Handle approvals and WETH wrapping/unwrapping

Three executor versions exist (`Executor01`, `Executor02`, `Executor03`), with automatic detection.

## Integration Best Practices

### Minimizing RPC Calls

- **Event-based pricing** is required - use `StatefulEventSubscriber`
- **Always use Multicall** - batch multiple contract calls via `dexHelper.multiWrapper`
- **Reuse Contract/Interface instances** - never create new instances per pool to avoid memory leaks

### Pricing Accuracy

- **Replicate on-chain math exactly** - any discrepancy causes transaction failures or surplus/deficit
- Use the same mathematical operations, bit shifting, and precision as the smart contract
- Reference existing implementations (Uniswap V3, Curve V1, Balancer V2) for complex math

### getDexParam Requirements

When implementing `getDexParam()`, carefully configure:

- `needWrapNative`: DEX only deals with wrapped native tokens (WETH)
- `dexFuncHasRecipient`: DEX can transfer to arbitrary recipient
- `exchangeData`: ABI-encoded call data for the DEX
- `targetExchange`: Contract address to call
- `spender`: Contract to approve (defaults to `targetExchange`)
- `transferSrcTokenBeforeSwap`: Transfer tokens before swap (vs encoding in `exchangeData`)
- `returnAmountPos`: Offset of return amount in function outputs (use `extractReturnAmountPosition` helper or `undefined`)

### Base Classes

- **SimpleExchange**: For simple DEXes without complex pool state (WETH, Lido, lending protocols)
- **SimpleExchangeWithRestrictions**: For DEXes with blacklists or regional restrictions
- **StatefulRpcPoller**: For DEXes without reliable event support (higher RPC cost)

## Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled (`strict: true`, `strictNullChecks: true`)
- **Prettier**: Single quotes, 2 space tabs, trailing commas, 80 char line width
- **ESLint**: Airbnb base config
- **Imports**: Always remove unused imports - keep import statements clean and minimal
- **Comments**: Add comments only for complex logic that requires clarification. Simple, self-explanatory code should remain uncommented. Avoid redundant comments that merely restate what the code does.
- **Tests excluded from build**: `*.test.ts` files excluded from compilation

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: `master`
- Create feature branches: `feature/<dex-name>` or `feat/<ticket-id>`
- PRs must include:
  - DEX background and pricing logic explanation
  - Links to protocol documentation
  - Important contract addresses
  - All three test types passing
